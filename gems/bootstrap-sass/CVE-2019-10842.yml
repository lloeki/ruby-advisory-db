title: Arbitrary code execution (via backdoor code)
date: 2019-04-04
description: |
  Arbitrary code execution (via backdoor code) was discovered in bootstrap-sass
  3.2.0.3, when downloaded from rubygems.org. An unauthenticated attacker can
  craft the ___cfduid cookie value with base64 arbitrary code to be executed
  via eval(), which can be leveraged to execute arbitrary code on the target
  system. Note that there are three underscore characters in the cookie name.
  This is unrelated to the __cfduid cookie that is legitimately used by
  Cloudflare.
